# Dashboard Navigation
The dashboard consists of the following pages:
- [Home](/dashboardnav?id=home) (Dashboard/Condition Monitoring)
- [History](/dashboardnav?id=history) (Data Collection/Data Analysis)
- [Logs](/dashboardnav?id=logs) (Predictive Maintenance)
- [Anomalies](/dashboardnav?id=anomalies) (Machine Learning/Predictive Maintenance)

The `Navigation Bar (Navbar)` is used to navigate through the pages
There are also different components that appear based on the active page
- Toggle <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on fa-xl"></i><br>
  (Appears in `Home`)
- Status
  (Appears in `Home` when the **toggle** is **on**)
- Configuration <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders fa-xl"></i><br>
  (Appears in `Home` when the **toggle** is **off**)
